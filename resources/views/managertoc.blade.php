                                    time to require performance of any term shall in no manner affect our right at a later time to
                                    enforce the same term unless this right is expressly waived by us in writing. These Terms together
                                    with our Privacy Policy constitute the final, complete and exclusive agreement with respect to your
                                    use of SPINSTATZ.<br>

                                    Certain portions of this Section 20 are deemed to be a &ldquo;written agreement to arbitrate&rdquo;
                                    pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and SPINSTATZ agree that we intend that this Section 20
                                    satisfies the &ldquo;writing&rdquo; requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.<br>
                                    1. First -- Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes. If any controversy, allegation, or claim
                                    arises out of or relates to the Website, the Content, your User-Generated Content, your Unsolicited

                                    which includes those actions set forth in Section 20(D) below), then you and we agree to send a
                                    written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute,
                                    along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most
                                    recent contact information that you provide us. But if no such information exists or if such
                                    information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 20(A). Your notice to us
                                    must be sent to: SPINSTATZ, LLC, <a

                                period of 60 days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, SPINSTATZ and you will
                                engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing
                                will require either you or SPINSTATZ to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with
                                respect to which you and SPINSTATZ, in each party&rsquo;s sole discretion, are not comfortable.<br>

                                Arbitration.<br>
                                If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 20(A) above within 60 days of receipt of the
                                notice, then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this
                                Section 20(B). If we cannot resolve an Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 20(A) above within
                                60 days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal
                                arbitration only if you and SPINSTATZ consent, in a writing signed by you and SPINSTATZ, LLC's
                                General Counsel, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration. In such a case (and only in
                                such a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; for the remainder of this
                                Section 20(B).<br>
                                Upon expiration of the applicable 60-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
                                law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then current
                                Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). If the
                                Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and
                                determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than 15
                                years experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the
                                Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary
                                Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000,
                                or if SPINSTATZ elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those
                                that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be
                                heard and determined by a three member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the
                                third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party appointed members or by the AAA in
                                accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case
                                may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of this User Agreement and any Additional
                                Terms, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record
                                and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award. If you and SPINSTATZ do not both consent to the
                                arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this
                                Section 20(B)(i), then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 20(B) will not apply to the
                                Excluded Dispute.<br>
                                If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling
                                or unable to set a hearing date within 60 days of the filing of a &ldquo;demand for arbitration,&rdquo;
                                then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and
                                Mediation Services Inc. (&ldquo;JAMS&rdquo;) using JAMS&rsquo; streamlined Arbitration Rules and
                                Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and a legal officer of
                                SPINSTATZ consents to in writing. The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and
                                the $250,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the
                                paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or
                                another arbitration service.<br>

                                Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution. In arbitration, as with a
                                court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of this User Agreement (and any Additional Terms) and can
                                award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys&rsquo; fees). However, WITH
                                ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME
                                ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS
                                LIMITED. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented
                                by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required,
                                then it will be conducted in the &ldquo;metropolitan statistical area&rdquo; (as defined by the U.S.
                                Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and
                                we will pay the administrative and arbitrator&rsquo;s fees and other costs in accordance with the
                                applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require SPINSTATZ to pay a
                                greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 20 to be enforceable, then
                                SPINSTATZ will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.
                                Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator&rsquo;s
                                decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute,
                                and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any
                                award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in
                                or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal
                                Arbitration Act.<br>
                                Limited Time to File Claims. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO
                                ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT AN EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT
                                (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 20(A) ABOVE) <span data-term="goog_225145524"

                                Injunctive Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 20 will not apply to any legal action
                                taken by SPINSTATZ to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with any loss,
                                cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Website, any Content, your
                                User-Generated Content or Unsolicited Ideas and Materials and/or SPINSTATZ's intellectual property
                                rights (including such SPINSTATZ may claim that may be in dispute), SPINSTATZ&rsquo;s operations,
                                and/or SPINSTATZ's products or services.<br>
                                Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                                either of us may bring a qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims
                                court.<br>
                                No Class Action Matters. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be
                                consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy
                                of any other party. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator
                                selected pursuant to Section 20(B)(i) above holds that this restriction is unconscionable or
                                unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 20(B) above to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute
                            must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 20(G) below.</p>

                                Federal and State Courts in Nashville, Tennessee. Except to the extent that arbitration is required
                                in Section 20(B) above, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any
                                action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or
